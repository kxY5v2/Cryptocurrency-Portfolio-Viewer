# Cryptocurrency-Portfolio-Viewer
A program that displays some information about my crypto currency in the console and creates a matplotlib chart to view some information about the portfolio.
All information is about my portfolio and is not meant to be used for anyone else although the template can be used for inspiration for others portfolio.
